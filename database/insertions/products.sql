call addProduct('AUDIOQUEST - EVERGREEN RCA-TO-RCA 1.5M', 'Your Ideal Introduction to High-End Audio AudioQuests clever new Evergreen cables are a simple and inexpensive introduction to the exciting world of hi-fi cables. The solid conductors minimize distortion, while the air-filled insulation ensures a more natural, focused sound. RFI signals are minimized for a clear, deep soundstage. If youve been using ordinary interconnects, you will be amazed at what a difference this simple addition can make. Named after the longest floating bridge in the world, Evergreen is a very affordable, yet extremely effective upgrade for any system. If youve always wondered what all the fuss is about, but dont want to risk a huge investment, Evergreen is your bridge to a bigger, sweeter sound. Evergreens solid Long-Grain Copper conductors allow a smoother and clearer sound than cables using regular OFHC (Oxygen-Free High-Conductivity) copper. OFHC is a general metal industry specification regarding loss without any concern for distortion. LGC has fewer oxides within the conducting material, less impurities, less grain boundaries, and definitively better performance. Any solid material adjacent to a conductor is actually part of an imperfect circuit. Wire insulation and circuit board materials all absorb energy (loss). Some of this energy is stored and then released as distortion. Evergreen uses air-filled Foamed-Polyethylene Insulation on both conductors because air absorbs next to no energy and Polyethylene is low-loss and has a benign distortion profile. Thanks to all the air in Foamed-PE, it causes much less of the out-of-focus effect common to other materials. 100% shield coverage is easy. Preventing captured RF Interference from modulating the equipments ground reference requires AudioQuests Noise-Dissipation System. Noise-Dissipation System prevents a significant amount of RFI from reaching the equipments ground plane.

It even offers compatibility with a range of plug-ins that allows functions to be extended on demand.Nikon Coolpix L4 feature highlights:High performance from a small CCDUtilizing space-efficient design parameters that help facilitate the compact size of the Coolpix L2/L3/L4, the 1/2.5-inch CCD adds the advantage of outstandingly high performance. Boasting effective pixel values of 4 million, the CCD enables the capture of crisp-focus images that retain their high quality even when significantly enlarged.3x zoom capabilityThe remarkably compact dimensions of the Coolpix L-line cameras belie the incorporation of powerful 38-114mm Zoom-Nikkor lenses (35mm equivalent), ensuring the freedom of a 3x zoom. This precision lens allows zooming in for tightly composed portraits or zooming way out for expansively wide views, providing greater compositional independence than the average digital camera. Macro mode allows shooting from as close as 4 centimeters.Simple-to-use features improve images in-cameraA range of unique Nikon functions enables the photographer to actually improve images in-camera. Available in playback mode, the D-Lighting function selects and creates a copy of images with excessive backlight or insufficient flash illumination, adding light and detail wherever needed while keeping other areas as they were. The Face-priority AF function automatically detects and then focuses in on peoples faces, regardless of where they are in the frame, ensuring superb crisp-focus portraits. The In-Camera Red-Eye Fix function analyzes each image, automatically finding and then correcting any accidental red-eye, which sometimes occurs in flash photography, to produce more natural-looking portraits.AA-size battery compatibilityDespite its compact dimensions, the Coolpix L4 is compatible with AA-size batteries, one of the most widely available battery sizes in the world. The power to shoot approximately 250 shots when using alkaline batteries greatly augments its compact convenience.Other features:Unique combination of all-round quality, ease of operation, and elegant styling makes the Coolpix L4 the compact digital camera of choice for entry-level photographersCompact, portable dimensions: 86.5 x 60.5 x 34.5 millimeters (3.4 x 2.4 x 1.4 inches)Light weight: approximately 115 grams (4.1 ounces) (without battery and SD memory card)BSS (Best Shot Selector) automatically selects the shot with the sharpest focus from a series of consecutive imagesBlur Warning informs user after shooting if an image is blurredTime zone function enables local time to be set regardless of where you are in the worldSingle AF and Continuous AF selectable in Movie modeCapture modes: Single and Multi-Shot 16Built-in flash: features settings for Auto, Auto with red-eye reduction (In-Camera Red-Eye Fix), Off, Fill Flash, and Slow sync.Noise reduction provides more attractive results in low-light conditionsDigital zoom of up to 4xChoice of White Balance: Auto with TTL control, 6-mode manual (Daylight, Incandescent, Fluorescent, Cloudy, Flash, and White Bal.

Additional quick access touch-enabled settings include three Customizable Modes that get you to your favorite camera setup quickly, multiple Scene Modes and the new LUMIX Creative Control Mode. The DMC-GF3 provides a dedicated video button that can be used to switch to video capture quickly without changing modes.At the heart of the DMC-GF3s simplified functionality is a large 3.0-inch LCD (460k- dot) that allows for intuitive touch control of menus and most shooting, focusing, playback and effects controls. Menus can be customized using simple drag-and-drop actions like those on most touch-enabled smartphones. This allows for a custom user interface, giving Quick Menu access to functions that can be tailored to any users expertise level. Even the shutter can be triggered from the touch-enabled LCD by simply touching the subject you want focused and captured. Using the touch-screen operation, a user can lock onto a subject, enabling AF Tracking in both still and video modes. When youre ready to shoot, the subject will be in focus and ready to capture.For those who miss the tactile feel of a traditional DSLR mode dial, the DMC-GF3 offers an innovative mode thumb wheel that quickly cycles though all available modes with visual feedback provided on the large 3 touch-enabled LCD.Available Scene Modes:Portrait, Soft Skin, Scenery, Architecture, Sports, Peripheral Defocus, Flower, Food, Objects, Night Portrait, Night Scenery, Illuminations, Baby, Pet, Party and Sunset, which can all be controlled from the intuitive touch-enabled LCD.Built-in FlashThanks to a 6400 ISO, the DMC-GF3 shoots well under low light even without a flash. But there are times when a flash provides desired enhancements. So, like most DSLRs, the DMC-GF3 provides a built -in pop-up flash for added light during low-light shooting.Lens Options and 3D CaptureLUMIX G Series Compact System Cameras utilize the Micro Four Thirds (MFT) System lens mount. MFT offers greater size and weight reduction in the lens without compromising lens performance and clarity. The LUMIX G MFT System offers a selection of 12 high performance fixed focal length and variable aperture G Vario zooms, including a highly versatile 3D lens capable of capturing both 2D and 3D images at the same time. There are lens adaptors available for mounting older Leica M and Leica R lenses, including older LUMIX full Four Thirds lenses. An innovative 14-140mm HD G Vario lens provides the best of video and still-image shooting with a long 10x range and near silent high-speed focusing. When connected to the DMC-GF3, ultra fast focusing and auto subject track AF can be achieved.Many LUMIX MFT lenses come with MEGA O.I.S. (Optical Image Stabilization) built-in. This feature helps prevent blurring from hand-shake. Working together with the cameras Intelligent ISO Control, which reduces motion blur by adjusting the ISO sensitivity if the subject moves, youre sure to capture images that are sharp.Dust Reduction SystemAs with many interchangeable lens cameras, dust on the sensor reduces image clarity. To eliminate this potential, the DMC-GF3 has a Dust Reduction System that uses a supersonic wave filter in front of the Live MOS sensor. Vibrating vertically around 50,000 times per second, the filter repels dust and other particles effectively.HD Video CaptureThe LUMIX DMC-GF3 also shoots 1080/60i High Definition video using the AVCHD format (sensor output 30 fps). It offers a built-in mono microphone and includes a wind-cut function that further enhances the sound as it helps reduce noise caused by background wind. An audio meter can be displayed on the LCD for monitoring audio levels. Captured video can be played back in High Definition via an optional HDMI mini cable directly to an HD-compatible TV, or played directly on Panasonic VIERA TVs via the SD card. New near silent focusing features offered in several LUMIX Micro Four Thirds lenses help keep lens noise at bay, while the touch-enabled LCD allows you to automatically keep active subjects in focus with touch-enabled subject AF Tracking.Faster, Accurate Pinpoint FocusingContrast Detection Auto Focustechnology used in point-and-shoot and new mirrorless Compact System Cameras now approaches the speeds that were once only available from traditional professional-level DSLRs. The DMC-GF3 now offers the new LUMIX Light Speed Auto Focus technology developed for the highly regarded GH2. LUMIX Light Speed AF locks onto a subject quickly so you wont suffer from shutter lag frustration.Contrast Auto Focusingalso offers greater shot accuracy due to fewer hardware components needed vs. traditional DSLR phase difference systems, thus fewer pictures will suffer from system focusing errors (e.g., the accuracy of Contrast AF is approx. 90% at F1.4, while Phase Difference AF is approx. 60%).&nbsp;Select the Pinpoint AF from the menu.Touch the point for auto focusing.Enlarge the image to finely adjust the point.Focus and shoot with the touch shutter.Manual control over focus is available in the DMC-GF3 and now features a quick 4x magnification feature. By simply touching the subject, that subject is then enlarged in a small window, allowing you to keep the rest of the image in view as a framing reference. Beyond 4x, that small window fills the monitor so even more control over focus fine-tuning can be achieved. This handy feature is available from both the MF Assist (Manual Focus) and AF + MF focus modes.The DMC-GF3 now offers a large LCD touch-focus area, enabling touch-focus control from any part of the image as seen on the LCD. Unlike traditional DSLRs that limit the number and position of focus points, the DMC-GF3 uses the entire image sensor and can even fine-tune focus with a new fine-tuning Pinpoint AF feature. When Pinpoint AF is enabled, the image is enlarged, allowing for pixel-level setting of the focus area desired. Once set, the DMC-GF3 will use this fine-tuned focus point to produce a sharp, detailed image.Intelligent Auto and Intelligent Auto Plus (iA, iA+)The DMC-GF3 has advanced functions that will satisfy experienced photographers, yet is easy enough for beginners to use comfortably in both photo and video recording modes with iA (Intelligent Auto) Plus. In the new iA Plus Mode, the defocusing area, exposure control and white balance can be adjusted visually for scenes where a slight manual adjustment may produce a more desired result.Defocus: the background defocus can be adjustedColor: the white balance can be adjusted from red color to blue colorBrightness: the exposure compensation can be adjustedColor and EffectsWith LUMIX Creative Control Mode, accessed from the Mode dial at the top of the camera, an expressive look to the image can be achieved without the need for complicated post-processing software. Common effects can be achieved via the touch-control menu as a pre-setting in an easy-to-understand what you see is what you get experience. Effects include: Expressive, Retro, High Key, Sepia, High Dynamic and now, Miniature Effect.Using the LUMIX Photo Style Mode, popular color effects can be achieved. These settings can be further enhanced with fine-tuning of Contrast, Sharpness, Saturation and Noise Reduction. Color effects include: Standard, Vivid, Natural, Monochrome, Scenery, Portrait and Custom.Venus Engine FHDThe new LUMIX Venus Engine FHD offers vastly improved compensation for electronic noise under low light and shadows where higher ISOs typically add grain to the image. Circuitry on the large DSLR sized 12.1-megapixel sensor further reduces low-noise signal problems at the pixel level and at the amplifier circuit level. As a result, higher ISOs with much lower noise can be achieved. This means faster action-stopping shutter speeds in low light, and a maximum achievable ISO of 6400.The new Venus Engine FHD uses new Intelligent Resolution technology to sharpen edge detail without softening fine detail. In addition to maximizing edge and fine detail, the Venus Engine offers Intelligent D-Range Control. Intelligent D-Range Control enables maximum capture of the images full range of brightness, without blown-out highlights and muddying shadows', null, 'Panasonic', 'Default', 23, 'B0054YVA8S', 81398.15, 60265.71, 'http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41mMCTkfCfL._SX300_.jpg', '47b7773c-6f5b-4435-861a-35e22942e9be');

This  resolution means gorgeous full-screen images on your computer (even with a  19-inch monitor) and prints that look great at sizes up to 8 by 10 inches. If  youre hoping for a camera that captures even detail in each photo, consider  Canons 3-megapixel S30 or 4-megapixel S40.OpticsA 3x optical zoom lens (35-105mm equivalent) aids in photo composition, and an  additional 2.5x digital zoom (7.5x total) further magnifies your image.  Remember, however, that digital zoom reduces the sharpness and detail of your  image, so its best used sparingly. Two systems help ensure your pictures will  be perfectly focused, even in challenging conditions: a multizone autofocus  works even when the subject of your photo isnt in the center of the scene, and  in low-light situations (a particular weakness of many digital cameras), a  focus-assist lamp sends out a small patterned beam to help the camera accurately  determine distance.More FeaturesThough its primarily designed as a point-and-shoot, the A40 includes a  surprising number of advanced features for photographers who want more creative  control, including aperture priority, shutter priority, and full manual modes,  exposure compensation, low-light manual shutter speeds, manual ISO and white  balance, and stitch assist, plus black-and-white, sepia, vivid, and neutral  modes.A movie mode captures video clips with sound. Depending upon resolution, these  clips can last from 10 to 30 seconds. The limited length and resolution of these  clips guarantees that this feature wont replace your camcorder, but its  perfect for when you just want to capture a quick movie and e-mail it to a  friend or relative.The A40 is the successor to last years A20. Physically, the two cameras are  nearly identical, but the new model has substantially more manual controls and a  movie mode.PowerThe A40 uses four AA batteries, and a set of alkalines is included. We dont  recommend using alkaline batteries in digital cameras unless you have no  alternative, since the high power demands of digital cameras drain alkaline  batteries ridiculously quickly. Instead, we prefer lithium batteries for  occasional users, since these last much longer and also stay fresh if your  camera sits unused for months at a time. If you use the camera more than once  every couple of weeks, we strongly recommend getting a set of rechargeable NiMH  batteries and a charger. These can be recharged hundreds of times and hold an  excellent charge, but will lose their power in as little as a month of disuse.  Many people solve this problem by purchasing a charger with two sets of  batteries, keeping one set in the camera and the other in the charger at all  times.Storage and TransferImages are stored on standard Type I CompactFlash cards. Consider the included 8  MB card a starter capacity, since its 12-picture limit means youll need to  return to your computer often to transfer images and free up the card for more  pictures. A 128 MB card is a great size for this camera, storing around 200  images. To transfer images to your computer, simply attach the included USB  cable between your PC and your camera. Your computer should automatically  recognize your camera and let you move the pictures to your hard drive.PrintingCanon has introduced a series of printers designed to work directly with the  A40. Using these printers, no computer is required--simply connect the camera to  the printer and start printing. The CP-10 produces credit-card-sized prints, and  the CP-100 makes 4-by-6-inch prints. Both use continuous-tone technology for  results that are indistinguishable from traditional photos. Of course, photos  from your camera can also be printed on any home computer system with an inkjet  printer, sent off for online processing, or simply enjoyed on your computer  screen.SizeDimensions of 4.3 by 2.8 by 1.5 inches put the A40 in the middle of the  compact-camera pack. The plastic body keeps weight down to 8.8 ounces.Contents and Recommended AccessoriesThe package includes the A40 camera, AV and USB cables, wrist strap, printed  manual, software suite, four AA batteries, and an 8 MB memory card.Everything you need to get started is included in the box, but a few well-chosen  accessories can help you get even more from your camera. We strongly recommend  the addition of a larger memory card (a 128 MB card holds around 200 images), a  set of rechargeable batteries, and a carrying case.

They push the leading edge of lens-making in their effort to provide the glass that makes the worlds greatest pictures.AF Nikkor lenses work with Nikon SLRs for optimal performance, even the very latest. The Nikon 24mm f2.8D AF Wide-Angle Nikkor is a compact ultra-wide-angle lens constructed with superb optical design for architecture, wedding, and landscape photography. It features 84-degree (61-degree with Nikon DX format) picture coverage with edge-to-edge sharpness. The Close Range Correction (CRC) system provides high performance at both near and far focusing distances, for distortion-free pictures as close as one foot.Nikon Super Integrated Coating ensures exceptional performanceTo enhance the performance of its optical lens elements, Nikon employs an exclusive multilayer lens coating that helps reduce ghost and flare to a negligible level. Nikon Super Integrated Coating achieves a number of objectives, including minimized reflection in the wider wavelength range and superior color balance and reproduction. Nikon Super Integrated Coating is especially effective for lenses with a large number of elements, like our Zoom-Nikkors. Also, Nikons multilayer coating process is tailored to the design of each particular lens. The number of coatings applied to each lens element is carefully calculated to match the lens type and glass used, and also to assure the uniform color balance that characterizes Nikkor lenses. This results in lenses that meet much higher standards than the rest of the industry.Close-Range Correction systemThe Close-Range Correction (CRC) system is one of Nikons most important focusing innovations, for it provides superior picture quality at close focusing distances and increases the focusing range. With CRC, the lens elements are configured in a floating element design wherein each lens group moves independently to achieve focusing. This ensures superior lens performance even when shooting at close distances.Distance informationD-type and G-type Nikkors relay subject-to-camera distance information to AF Nikon camera bodies. This then makes possible advances like 3D Matrix Metering and 3D Multi-Sensor Balanced Fill-Flash. Note: D-type and G-type Nikkors provide distance information to the following cameras: Auto exposure; F6, F5, F100, F90X, F80, F75, F70, F65, F60, F55, F50, Pronea S, Pronea 600i, D2 series, D1 series, D100, and D70s/D70.

call addProduct('Toshiba SD-2200 DVD Player', 'Not long ago, we would have considered Toshibas SD-2200 a steal. After all, this DVD player performs flawlessly when it comes to audio-video processing, resulting in good picture quality and dynamite sound. The SD-2200 also has dual-disc capacity, includes a built-in Dolby Digital decoder, and plays High Definition Compatible Discs (HDCDs). However, other manufacturers have caught up to Toshibas lead in the DVD player arena, producing players of equal quality and reducing the SD-2200 to a good value rather than a steal.Toshiba has taken a step backwards in the SD-2200s design by offering a joystick-style remote control that inhibits your ability to easily access menus and perform setup functions.If the presence of a built-in Dolby Digital decoder appeals to you, however, the SD-2200 is worth its weight. In addition to offering 5.1-channel audio jacks, it has optical and coaxial digital-audio outputs, as well as composite-, component-, and S-video outputs.The front array of buttons and LEDs center around the disc tray, which loads a single disc at a time. We found the tray mechanism to be somewhat flimsy and prone to breakage. The automated mechanism also makes a disturbing humming noise for several seconds as it goes through its motions.A pair of open/close buttons--labeled 1 and 2--are on the right of the disc tray. (Curiously, there are no matching open/close disc buttons on the remote control.) A pair of LEDs flanks the left side of the disc tray. With two DVDs in the machine, a red LED indicates that the first disc is in standby or play mode, while a green LED shows that a second disc is on deck. Combined with the red power indicator, we found these lights distracting in our darkened home theater. Given the fact that the SD-2200 has a front-panel display-off switch, it seems counterproductive for Toshiba to include three brightly colored LEDs.Other front-panel operating buttons include play, pause, stop, skip, and a redundant disc select button. Unfortunately, there is no menu access button in case the remote is lost or rendered inoperable. We also wished this unit had a headphone jack.The onscreen setup display is identical to other Toshiba models. A button on the remote brings up a bar at the top of the display device that hosts icons for language, picture, audio, display, and operation. Although all of these setup functions are intuitive, the remote makes it difficult to easily access them.The remotes joystick is actually a small toggle button thats designed to replace the standard up/down and left/right arrow buttons on most remotes. The toggle switch is overly sensitive and, when you are moving inside a given menu, it tends to move on to the next icon or accidentally select the wrong setting. For example, in picture setup, each time we attempted to select the 16:9 aspect ratio, we inadvertently moved over to the audio menu without completing our mission.Fortunately, once we completed all our menu selections and dimmed the lights, the SD-2200 exhibited the usual high-quality sound and image weve come to expect from Toshiba. One of Toshibas best selling points is the companys unwavering focus on accurate gray-scale levels. The company adheres to the philosophy that faithful colors begin with a video decoders ability to produce true black and the SD-2200s image quality shows this philosophy. Dark scenes were well defined instead of murky, while bright scenes showed off the players ability to offer good edge definition, resulting in a more three-dimensional image. We were also pleased to see that the SD-2200 showed no digital artifacts during problematic action sequences with high data compression. Plus, we loved the onscreen meter, which allows you to monitor the bit-rate allocation for a given scene.Few manufacturers compare to Toshiba when it comes to offering superb digital-to-analog audio converters. With the SD-2200, explosions punched through the air with high velocity, while ambient sound effects trickled across the room with an eerie realism. Of course, there are many factors that contribute to a home theater systems ability to immerse the audience in a bug-infested jungle setting or to plop them down in the crowded streets of New York City. However, we have found that DVD players with inferior audio components invariably fail in this regard. Unlike lesser models, Toshibas SD-2200 brought out the best in our test system.The SD-2200 scored high on music reproduction as well. On well-recorded, standard CDs, the SD-2200 reinforced the notion that a good DVD player is more than capable of doubling up for music listening. Dynamic range--the ability to reproduce the highest highs and the lowest lows--was clear and relatively distortion free. On High Definition Compatible Discs, the SD-2200 kicked into cruise control and delivered satisfying renditions of everything from grunge guitar to slow sax.If youre impartial about HDCDs and you already have a home theater system with Dolby Digital 5.1-channel processing, Toshibas SD-2200 probably isnt a practical choice for a DVD player. After all, there are less expensive, single-disc players without built-in decoders, as well as higher-priced machines with more features and better build quality. If you want a DVD player thats well equipped for todays audio-video formats and does all the important things right, however, the SD-2200 is a good choice.--Eric GillPros:Versatile array of audio-video outputsBuilt-in Dolby Digital decoderExcellent digital-to-analog audio converterCons:Build quality isnt on par with players that cost only slightly moreJoystick-style remote makes it difficult to navigate onscreen menus', null, null, 'Default', 77, 'B00004RFHD', 6105.00, 5475.93, 'http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/310VKDX7EJL._SX300_.jpg', '13763835-9b99-4f72-abbb-cded19407a07');
