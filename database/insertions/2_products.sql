No additional licenses needed for extra countries, regions or services like traffic information or city guides. Data charges from network operators may apply.Voice Guidance and Traffic InformationTurn-by-turn, voice guided navigation comes free for both drivers and pedestrians. For drivers this includes lane assistance, traffic information, safety camera, and speed warnings. For pedestrians, this includes shortcuts through parks and pedestrian-only zones for over 100 cities around the world as well as 6,000 3D landmarks in over 200 cities to help you find exactly where you are.Unique Hybrid TechnologyOvi Maps is built on an advanced technology called hybrid vector maps. Vector maps are high quality but less data intensive and allow you to continue to navigate even if you lose your network connection. This means that maps downloaded or updated across a network connection are about half the size of bulky bitmaps used by other mobile map providers. The hybrid technology ensures that, unlike other providers, any downloaded map data is stored on the device for future use.No Network Connection Required When NavigatingAvoid expensive, battery-draining network connections with Nokias unique hybrid technology. Maps can be pre-loaded on to your Nokia smartphone so you can set Ovi Maps to offline mode, saving battery power, and the navigation system will still work. This is particularly useful for those worried about data connection costs when travelling abroad or when you are travelling through areas with little or no network coverage.Best Global CoverageYou take your mobile with you wherever you go in the world so, as standard, voice guided navigation for both pedestrians and drivers is available for 74 countries in 46 different languages and there are maps for over 180 countries. This gives you the best maps with the largest global coverage for free.Technical SpecificationsMusic playback file formats: AAC, AAC+, eAAC+, MP3, AMR-NB, WMAFM radio 87.5-108 MHz with RDS supportVideo playback file formats: .mp4, AVC/H.264, .wmv, RV, Flash Video, H.263/3GPPVideo streaming: .mp4, AVC/H.264, .wmv, RV, Flash Video, H.263/3GPPVideo recording file formats: .mp4 - default (VGA, QVGA) or .3gp (QCIF for MMS)3.5 mm Nokia audio connectorMicro-USB connector supports charging; USB PictBridge printingBluetooth 2.0 with Enhanced Data RateUPnP supportSupport for PC synchronization with Nokia PC Suite 7.1 (preinstalled) and Nokia Ovi SuiteE-mail supported protocols: IMAP4 (with idle), Nokia Messaging, Microsoft ActiveSync, POP3, SMTPSupport for Nokia Messaging service, Mail for Exchange, Lotus Notes Traveler', null, null, 'Default', 66, 'B002QEBM96', 21920.65, 20398.18, 'http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51hmy8NeW3L._SY300_.jpg', '6238c143-4eac-4383-a348-33739390af81');

With HDTV, the resolution is so much better that you can sit closer to a larger TV without noticing the pixels. So with HDTVs, the rule tends to be you can sit anywhere from 1.5 to 3 times the screen size (in inches) for the best experience.

Because 1080p provides twice the resolution of the high definition 720p or 1080i displays found in most HDTVs today, youll get more vivid pictures--no matter the scene or content. It delivers stunningly detailed images thanks to the high-speed Plush1080p video processor (with a 6-segment, 10,800 RPM color wheel), which up-converts 1080i signals to 1080p producing four times the resolution of traditional line doublers. The WD-65731 also features a cabinet with a simple, clean design with a compact footprint that will fit virtually any home theater furnishings without taking up a lot of space.It includes a QAM tuner thats fully compatible with unscrambled HDTV cable reception, and a wide variety of digital inputs (including two HDMI, three component, and two Firewire ports). And the sets CableCARD port means the set will also receive digital cable television systems services directly from a compatible cable operator without requiring a bulky, external cable box.The WD-65731 has a 1920 x 1080-pixel resolution, 16:9 aspect ratio, and compatibility with 480i/480p/720p/1080i video sources. It includes six 4:3 aspect ratio modes and two aspect ratio modes from 16:9 sources. Other convenience features include color temperature controls, full-screen image freeze, two tuner picture-in-picture (PIP), split screen, V-Chip parental controls, and a sleep timer.It pumps out audio via its integrated 20-watt speaker system (10 watts per two channels) and also offers Mitsubishis Level Sound Dynamics Limiter features, which evens out the sound of programs--even during loud commercial breaks. The IEEE 1394 (also known as Firewire or i.Link) multimedia connection provides simple, high-bandwidth, real-time audio, video and data networking between this Mitsubishi TV and digital video camcorders and compatible PC systems, enabling you to record SD or HD digital video with plug-and-play ease.

And for a 1080p HDTV like this model, even the high quality 720p and 1080i HDTV signals being broadcast need to be reformatted. The Plush 1080p feature set scales the picture precisely, with minimal side effects. And 1080i, currently the most common form of HDTV signal, is spectacular at 1080p.Rather than provide standard color and tint controls, Mitsubishis PerfectColor technology enables you to adjust the screens color palette with six independent color controls (magenta, red, yellow, green, cyan, and blue).The patented 150-watt TurboLight lamp system focuses light more efficiently onto the DLP chip to improve image brightness 10 percent over conventional lamp systems.Mitsubishis 4D Video Noise Reduction system provides a cleaner, clearer picture from nearly any source by analyzing multiple frames to identify and remove video noise or snow caused by distortions in the video signal. This effectively keeps detail in the foreground and eliminates background noise, even in fast moving scenes.Finally, the ClearThought set of features includes all-digital audio output (which converts analog audio signals to digital audio) and the NetCommand single-remote control home theater operation system (which allows you to set up and control components using simple on-screen icons). It also provides the TV Guide On Screen 8-day program guide system, which makes it easy to sort through all the television listings to find your favorite channels.Digital Cable ReadyYou can connect your cable television directly from the wall to this DLP TV without going through a cable box to receive all of your cable channels, including premium channels, and get an even better picture by doing so. This set has a slot on the back for a CableCARD, a device that descrambles subscribed channels. With the CableCARD (available from your local cable TV company), the TV&#xD5;s internal tuner will tune directly to the subscribed cable channels, eliminating the need for a separate cable box.When a digital cable TV channel is received via the CableCARD, it is decoded and remains a digital video signal all the way to the screen. Standard-definition digital channel signals are up-converted by the advanced processing capability in the set (see more about the Plush imaging feature below), giving it an HD-quality picture. The resulting image has the best possible quality, with maximum bandwidth, and minimal noise and distortion.Whats in the BoxDLP TV, multibrand NetCommand remote control (with 2 AA batteries), IR emitter cableWarrantyOne year on parts.

There&rsquo;smore to the story.Unlike some other high frame rate technologies, Motionflow also includes Sony&rsquo;s unique Image Blur Reduction algorithm, which reduces blur from the original source image captured by a camera before applying motion enhancement technology.Judderis a visual artifact that shows up in video content that has been converted from film-based content. A visible jerking or stuttering effect can sometimes be seen during motion sequences on converted film-based content that may be noticeable on scenes that include panning.There are many forms of high frame rate technology in the market today, but only Motionflow 120Hz technology uses special Sony algorithms designed to intelligently detect and apply the right amount of enhancement to reduce judder and deliver a smoother, sharper picture with more natural motion of the original film.Go back to list of all features.24p True CinemaMovies and many prime time TV programs are shot at 24 frames per second. This means that TVs operating at any refresh rate that is not an even multiple of 24 will have to do some interpolation to present the content. TVs operating at at 30Hz or 60Hz traditionally solved this via a method called 2:3 pulldown. The television repeats the first film frame over the first two fields of video, and the second film frame over the next three fields of video (1, 1, 2, 2, 2), and continues to do this with the 3rd and 4th frames, the 5th and 6th framer (1,1,2,2,2 - 3,3,4,4,4 - 5,5,6,6,6), and so on until 24 frames are displayed over 60 refresh cycles. This discrepancy in the number of times frames are displayed can lead to a jerky motion in filmed material which some viewers notice&nbsp; for example, especially with scenes that pan.120, on the other hand, is an even multiple of 24. Ttelevisions with 24p capability, operating at 120Hz, can display an equal number of frames for every refresh cycle.The benefit&mdash; You can watch movies in natural, cinematic motion, the way they are seen at the cinema. Every single frame of the movie can now be seen without using additional video processing that converts film-based images to video reproduction. Additionally, 24p True Cinema input capability can be used along with Motionflow 120Hz technology for outstanding fluid motion beyond what you would typically see at the cinema. Once you experience 24p video it will be hard to view video without it.(Found in S, V, W, Z, and XBR Series HDTVs).Sonys Blu-ray disc players wisely take advantage of this by including 24p output capability.Go back to list of all features.10-bit Processor and 10-bit PanelWhile it&rsquo;s great to state that a TV is capable of creating billions of colors it&rsquo;s a whole lot better when you have a true 10-bit display that can actually display them. Sony combines 10-bit processing with a 10-bit panel, allowing 64 times the levels of color expression. What that translates to is smoother transitions from color to color and subtle color changes faithfully reproduced without a paint-by-numbers look.So, where x.v. color expands the available range of colors your HDTV can display, Deep Color increases the number of colors your HDTV can display within that range, for smoother transitions from color to color.Lets HDTVs and other displays go from millions of colors to billions of colorsEliminates on-screen color banding, for smooth tonal transitions and subtle gradations between colorsEnables increased contrast ratioCan represent many times more shades of gray between black and white.&nbsp;(Found in all Z and XBR Series HDTVs)Go back to list of all features.Rich Graphic On-Screen Control InterfaceDelivering a fun user experience is what the new rich graphics are designed to do.

That&rsquo;s it.Go back to list of all features.Audio FeaturesS-Force Front SurroundBuilt around a sophisticated set of Sony algorithms, the S-Force Front Surround enhancement function generates realistic surround sound from the two speakers in the TV. Unlike some other virtual surround technologies, S-Force Front Surround sound does not need to be bounced off of side walls or other surfaces to hear three-dimensional sound. No matter what the size or shape of the room its possible to hear sounds from behind you.SRS TruSurround XTTruSurround is a patented SRS technology that solves the problem of playing 5.1 multichannel content over two speakers. TruSurround delivers a compelling, virtual surround sound experience through any two-speaker playback system, including internal television speakers and headphones. It is fully compatible with all multichannel formats up to 5.1 channels. High-quality virtual surround sound can be experienced with just the two hidden, downward-firing side-mounted 2.2-channel dome speakers built into the TV.SRS TruSurround XT technology delivers an amazing, simulated 3D effect with clear dialog and powerful bass.TruSurround XT audio also adds three audio enhancement technologies to produce an amazingly immersive sound experience.Dialog Clarity brings movie dialog into Focus during the playback of any surround-encoded material to make speech much clearer and crisper.TruBass creates incredible deep rich bass allowing a person to perceive significantly deeper, richer low bass tones that are far beyond the physical low frequency capabilities of the speaker itself.The SRS WOW feature widens the soundstage by processing standard two-channel stereo material as well as multi-channel encoded material for a dramatic improvement in the playback of any stereo audio over a two-speaker system.Stereo broadcast reception is offered for MTS and SAP with 181-channel capacity. A sound leveler keeps audio volume consistent during channel changing.Go back to list of all features.Which Size HDTV is Right for My Room?With standard-definition TVs, the rule used to be that viewers would feel comfortable watching a set from a distance of 3 to 6 times the screen size in inches. With HDTV, the resolution is so much better that you can sit closer to a larger TV without noticing the pixels. So with HDTVs, the rule tends to be you can sit anywhere from 1.5 to 3 times the screen size (in inches) for the best experience.If you know the size of the room you have already, where you want to sit, and where your new HDTV should go once you get it, you can figure out the size HDTV you should get.Minimum size= Viewing distance/3Maximum size=Viewing distance/1.5Go back to list of all features.Which Sony Bravia Series is Right For You?Size RangeResolutionBravia EngineACETrue 24pDMexTV Guide IPG3D Graphic Onscreen Controls120 Hz10-BitDeep Colorx.v.
